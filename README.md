Developing a plagiarism detector with sklearn.SVC in Amazon Sagemaker.

The project is divided into two main components: 
1. `2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`: data preprocessing and analysis with the definition of the most representative components for model training
2. `3_Training_a_Model.ipynb`: model developing and deployment
